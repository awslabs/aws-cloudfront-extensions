CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials. Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required. With CloudShell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), experiment with AWS service APIs using the AWS SDKs, or use a range of other tools to be productive.</description></item><item><title>Contributing via pull requests</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/contribution/pr/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/contribution/pr/readme/</guid><description>Pull Request Checklist You are able to implement a new feature or fix an issue by pull requests, before sending pull requests, make sure you followed this list

If you already have an environment to use, you can skip this step.
To create a CloudFront distribution with an Amazon S3 origin, you will do the following steps
Create an S3 bucket Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.</description></item><item><title>S3 bucket</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/cleanup/s3-bucket/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/cleanup/s3-bucket/readme/</guid><description>To clean S3 bucket
Go to the S3 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
Enter cloudfront-extension-workshop in the search bar of Buckets. Then select the radio button to the right of the retrieved bucket. Then press the Empty button at the top. To activate the Empty button of the empty bucket, enter the bucket name and press the Empty button to delete all bucket
When the message that the deletion is complete appears, click Exit on the upper right to complete</description></item><item><title>AWS CDK</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/prerequisite/aws-cdk/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/prerequisite/aws-cdk/readme/</guid><description>The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
AWS CDK is not pre-installed in AWS CloudShell currently, so you will need to install it
Install the AWS CDK Toolkit globally using the following Node Package Manager command.
npm install -g aws-cdk You will need to add sudo in front of the command If you see below error</description></item><item><title>CloudFront distribution</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/cleanup/cf-distribution/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/cleanup/cf-distribution/readme/</guid><description>To clean CloudFront distribution

Download a sample AWS SAM application After completing UPLOAD CLOUDFRONT+ CODE INTO CLOUDSHELL section, you have uploaded CloudFront+ into CloudShell, go to CloudFront+ folder and perform following commands:
cd edge/nodejs/ sam init Choose 1 - AWS Quick Start Templates
Choose 1 - nodejs12.</description></item><item><title>Test the Lambda@Edge function</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/develop/test-function/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/develop/test-function/readme/</guid><description>In this step, you will test the Lambda@Edge function created in the last step
Test Lambda@Edge function To test Lambda@Edge function:
Open AWS Lambda Console in https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions
Choose the function you have created, it would be similar to the following
Choose Code tab of the page, as shown in the following image, you will see the code which has been deployed by AWS Serverless Application Model(SAM)</description></item><item><title>Trigger from CloudFront</title><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/develop/trigger-function/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/develop/trigger-function/readme/</guid><description>Add a CloudFront Trigger to Run the Function Now that you have tested the Lambda function, in this step, you will configure the CloudFront trigger to run your function to add the headers in any response that CloudFront receives from the origin for your distribution.
To configure the CloudFront trigger for your function
Choose Configuration tab and choose Triggers, you will see there is an API Gateway trigger which is deployed by hello world SAM template, delete it since you will not need it in this workshop</description></item><item><title/><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/lambdaedge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/lambdaedge/</guid><description>Lambda@Edge Authentication Name Description Version Release Authentication by Cognito Integrate with Cognito to provide authentication service. v1.0.0 Progress Authentication by native library Integrate the native library, in this case using C library and include file, which&amp;rsquo;s acting authentication function. v1.0.0 Todo Adding security header Add security header into reponse after successful authentication, this function will add &amp;lsquo;strict-transport-security&amp;rsquo; to force browser using HTTPS.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/readme/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
