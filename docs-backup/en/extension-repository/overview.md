The solution provides a set of ready-to-use extensions (Lambda@Edge functions, CloudFront functions, CloudFormation templates) that could be useful when you use CloudFront. You can deploy them from the solution web console. After deployment, you can directly use it without programming or customize it when needed.

You can use the following extensions:

- [True Client IP](true-client-ip.md)
- [Pre-warming](pre-warming.md)
- [Redirect by Country](redirect-by-country.md)
- [Resize Image](resize-image.md)
- [More extensions in Serverless Application Repository (SAR)](more-extension-in-sar.md)
