With WAF & Shield Automations you can protect your web services with a set of AWS WAF pre-configured rules to protect against common application vulnerabilities or other unwanted traffic, by using the embedded AWS Shield to defend against the DDoS(Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.

In this workshop, you will deploy AWS WAF & Shield Automations by AWS CDK to protect the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) as the test web application.

The Juice Shop is an Open Source web application that is intentionally insecure, you can find a more detailed introduction about the OWASP Juice Shop in [Pwning OWASP Juice Shop](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/).
