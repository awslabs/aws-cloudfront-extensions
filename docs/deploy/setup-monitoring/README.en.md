In this section, we will enable CloudFront standard log and monitor CloudFront metrics on CloudFront Extensions console.

After deployment, you will see two CloudFormation stacks.

Setup monitoring by following steps:

1. Go to [CloudFormation console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#)
2. Switch **View nested** on.
