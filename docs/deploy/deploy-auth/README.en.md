title: Deploy a Lambda@Edge function to authenticate with Cognito
weight: 1
---

In this step, you will find and deploy one serverless application that have been published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository. The application enables authentication with Amazon Cognito for your website.

The following diagram is a high-level architecture of this lab

![Auth Architecture](/images/auth-architecture.png)


There are two S3 bucket 
- Private S3 bucket: contains private content, users can not access the content before login by Cognito
- Public S3 bucket: contains the demo website resources, users can access it through CloudFront publicly

Here is how it works

1. The user access Amazon Cognito UI page to login and authenticate.
2. After authentication, Cognito generates a JWT(Json Web Token) then responds with a redirect containing the JWT embedded in the URL
3. The userâ€™s web browser extracts JWT from the URL and makes a request to private content in S3 bucket, adding Authorization request header with JWT
4. Amazon CloudFront routes the request to the nearest AWS edge location. The CloudFront distribution will launch a Lambda@Edge function on ViewerRequest event
5. Lambda@Edge decodes and verify the JWT 
6. After passing all the verification steps, Lambda@Edge remove the Authorization header and allows the request to pass through to the origin(Private S3 bucket)
7. The private content in origin S3 bucket will be returned to the user

## Deploy resources from CloudFormation

1. Launch workshop stack by clicking this [link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=auth-at-edge&templateURL=https://do-not-delete-cloudfront-ext-workshop.s3.amazonaws.com/edge-auth-workshop.template). 
2. Keep all the default parameters for the stack and click **Deploy**.
3. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to be completed.
4. You can check the deployment status in CloudFormation Console. Go to [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#) and choose the stack named **auth-at-edge**. 
5. In the Outputs section, it lists all the resources created by the stack, find the **CloudFrontDistribution**, **CognitoUserPoolId** and **DemoUrl** in the outputs, we will use them in next steps.

## Deploy auth application in SAR

To find and configure an application in the AWS Serverless Application Repository

1. Open [the AWS Serverless Application Repository page](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications) in the Console
2. Check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies**
3. Search the application name **authentication-with-cognito**, choose the application and click **Deploy**.
   > All CloudFront extensions can be find by searching **aws-cloudfront-extensions**
4. On the application detail page, paste the Cognito User Pool Id which was copied from the stack outputs, check **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles**
5. Click **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is completed, it will redirect to application over page
6. Choose **AuthenticationByCognito** to configure the Lambda function

## Add a CloudFront Trigger to Run the Function

To configure the CloudFront trigger for your function
1. Choose **Action** tab and choose **Deploy to Lambda@Edge**
   ![CF Trigger](/images/CF_trigger_2.png)
2. On the **Deploy to Lambda@Edge** page, enter the following information:
   - Distribution
     The CloudFront distribution which has been created in the stack
   - Cache behavior
     Select **private/***
   - CloudFront event
     In the drop-down list, choose **Viewer Request**
   Click **Deploy**

4. Wait for the function to replicate. This typically takes several minutes.
5. You can check to see if replication status in the [CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and viewing your distribution. Wait for the distribution status to change from In Progress back to **Deployed**, which means that your function has been replicated.

## Test the function

1. Open the DemoUrl which is shown in the stack outputs
2. To verify that Lambda@Edge is protecting the private content and blocking unauthorized requests, click on **Retrieve Private Data** button. You should see an alert dialog popup noting that Lambda@Edge has blocked your access as you have not logged in

3. To gain access to private data, you have to authenticate first. Click **Authenticate with Amazon Cognito** button, you will be presented with Amazon Cognito Custom UI

4. Enter your username and password if you have one, or else you need to sign up
   Click on Sign up and follow instructions to register a new username, password, and verify your email address. Note that as part of the verification process, you will need to copy the one-time code sent to your email. Once authenticated, your browser will redirect back to the Private Content Viewer page, but this time you will have a JSON Web Token
5. Click on **Retrieve Private Data** button again, and the private content is shown this time
