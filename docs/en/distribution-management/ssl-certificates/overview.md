## SSL Certificates

You can use this solution to automatically create or import SSL Certificates and associate them to new CloudFront distributions. The solution provides two kinds of jobs: Create Certificates Job and Import Certificate Job. You can use then on UI or via API calls.

This chapter covers the following topics:

- [Create new certificates](./create-new-certificates.md)
- [Import existing certificates](./import-existing-certificates.md)
- [List SSL certificates](./list-certificates.md)
- [DNS validation process with your DNS Provider](./dns-validation-process.md)
- [Adding CloudFront record for CNAME with your DNS Provider](./add-record-for-cname.md)
- [Clean up resources](./clean-up-resources.md)
