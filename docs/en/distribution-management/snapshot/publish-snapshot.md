Before you can use a snapshot, you must create a snapshot first.

1. Log in to the web console.
2. In the left sidebar, under **Configuration**, select **Snapshot**. 
3. Click a distribution (you can find it by CNAMEs) that you want to take a snapshot to enter its page. 
4. Choose **Create Snapshot**. 
5. In the window that pops up, enter a *Snapshot Name* (a unique key used to identify this snapshot), and also Description. 
6. Choose **Create**.
