When you build systems on Amazon Web Service infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and Amazon Web Service. This [shared model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because Amazon Web Service operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate.

### IAM roles

Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles allow customers to assign granular access policies and permissions to services and users on the Amazon Web Service Cloud. This solution creates IAM roles that grant the solutionâ€™s access between the solution components.
