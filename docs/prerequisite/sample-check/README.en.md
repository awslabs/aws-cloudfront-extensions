Once the CloudFormation deployment is finished, please review the output tab.

1. Navigate to [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks).
2. Open **CFExtSampleWorkshop** stack (or the one you named during the CloudFormation installation).
3. Select the **Outputs** tab of the menu.
4. You will see 5 outputs such as below. Keep this page open, or capture them separately. Record the **DistributionID**, **CFDomainName** and **DemoDefaultUrl** since we will use them in further section.
