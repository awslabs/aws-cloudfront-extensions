### Out-of-box experience when integrating with external monitoring system

The fact that metrics and events are retrieved from different AWS services (for example, events are from Evert Bridge, access logs are from s3, etc.), make it a big challenge for improvement of monitor experience when using CloudFront. Customers have wanted to a universal place to handle those logs/events with generic monitoring capability. CloudFront+ has provided out-of-box monitoring solution to enhance the overall observability and simplify the integration of CloudFront and customersâ€™ existing monitoring system.
