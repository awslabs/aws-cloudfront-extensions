### One-Click to deploy commonly used CloudFront solutions

CloudFront Extensions offers common solutions for using CloudFront, such as Shield&WAF Deployment for CloudFront. The solutions are provided in pre-baked CloudFormation/CDK templates. Customers can have solution launched into their own AWS consoles with a few clicks.

### Out-of-box experience when integrating with external monitoring system

The fact that metrics and events are retrieved from different AWS services (for example, events are from Evert Bridge, access logs are from s3, etc.), make it a big challenge for improvement of monitor experience when using CloudFront. Customers have wanted to a universal place to handle those logs/events with generic monitoring capability. CloudFront Extensions has provided out-of-box monitoring solution to enhance the overall observability and simplify the integration of CloudFront and customers’ existing monitoring system.
