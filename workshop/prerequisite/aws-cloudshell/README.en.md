AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that makes it easy to securely manage, explore, and interact with your AWS resources. CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials. Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required. With CloudShell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), experiment with AWS service APIs using the AWS SDKs, or use a range of other tools to be productive. You can use CloudShell right from your browser and at no additional cost.

## Get started with AWS CloudShell

1. Go to [CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#)
2. In the top right corner of the console, make sure youâ€™re using this region: **N. Virginia (us-east-1)**

When AWS CloudShell launches in a new browser window for the first time, a welcome panel displays and lists key features. After you close this panel, status updates are provided while the shell configures and forwards your console credentials. When the command prompt displays, the shell is ready for interaction.


You can adjust the font size and CloudShell theme by clicking the setting icon in the top right corner of CloudShell
