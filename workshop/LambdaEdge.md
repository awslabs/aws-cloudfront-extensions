# Lambda@Edge Collection Roadmap

## Description
This solution is a collection of various Lambda@Edge extensions for using CloudFront.
Users are able to find the Lambda application in SAR(Serverless Application Repository) and deploy it with one-click. The solution covers common use scenarios, for example, authentication with Amazon Cognito on a CloudFront distribution, access relative content according to the device type.

It is an open-source project in GitHub, anyone is welcomed to contribute new Lambda@Edge features.
