title: View CloudFront metrics in dashboard 
weight: 1
---

CloudFront Extensions provides two kinds of monitoring: non-real time monitoring and realtime monitoring. You can choose one of them to deploy and use it to view CloudFront traffic metrics via built-in metrics dashboard or via API calls. The dashboard uses CloudFront standard log or realtime log to get the metrics.


1. Go to CloudFront Extensions console.
2. In the navigation panel, under **Monitoring**, choose **CloudFront traffic**.
2. Choose the sample website distribution (you can find its domain name in **CFExtSampleWorkshop** stack), select a time range when the sample website has traffic.

3. Click **Refresh** button. You will see the metrics in the dashboard.

Top url metric is collected daily, so it is an expected behavior that you don't see the metric right now, try it tomorrow.
