## Use Cases
The user is able to add below three headers to enable CORS in viewer response

- Access-Control-Allow-Methods

## Project Structure

It includes the following files and folders.

- cross-origin-resource-sharing.yaml - CloudFormation template that will create cross-origin-resource-sharing CloudFront Function.
- cross-origin-resource-sharing-with-cloudfront.yaml - it will not only deploy the CloudFront Function, but deploy a CloudFront distribution associated with the CloudFront Function. 


## Deployment

To deploy the stack, you can either use UI or AWS CLI

### UI
Go to [CloudFront Extensions Workshop](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/#cloudfront-function), find the CloudFront Function you would like to deploy and click **Deploy** button.


### AWS CLI

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name cross-origin-resource-sharing 
```


## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name cross-origin-resource-sharing
```
